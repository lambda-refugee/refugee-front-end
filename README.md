# Refugee Stories Front End

This application manages refugee stories which are stored in the [Refugee Backend Application](https://github.com/lambda-refugee/refugee-backend).  In order to use this application you will 
need both the front end and back end applications running.  If you change the deployment path of the
backend application you will need to update the URLs to the application in the javascript code and
rebuild the application.

By default these locations are set to:
